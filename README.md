# I believe Faizaan will win!
A poorly-optimized script to generate pre-filled Google Forms links.

In a desperate attempt to get Faizaan nominated for our high school's homecoming court, I created this script to automatically generate pre-filled Google Forms links so I could submit forms at a rapid pace without having to think of fake names and ID numbers. Shoutout to my English teacher for giving us 30 minutes of free time.

_PSA: Always limit your Google Forms to 1 submission per email address if you're trying to conduct a legitimate vote._


__Coming Soon: User input of entry IDs and form data with Bootstrap GUI.__
